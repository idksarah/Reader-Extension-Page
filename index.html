I think that this should be very helpful for English learning, since it aids the meaning and pronunciation aspect of the process.</p>

              <p class="text">-Highlighting multiple words will create a popup that can play the text-to-speech version of the highlighted text but will show no definition, since this was built using a Spanish-English dictionary API rather than a translator API. I may adjust this in the future so that this is more usable in different contexts and languages.</p>
              <p class="text"> -Certain words (like hackathon, an event where programmers attempt to "hack" something together, and fun fact! where this extension was designed) don't have a direct Spanish translation or a formal English definition, so the extension cannot provide the Spanish meaning, but oh well.</p>
              <p class="text">-I do not benefit whatsoever from this!! This is just a project for me to practice programming and to try to help others, so I hope you can understand if there's a few bugs or missing features.
